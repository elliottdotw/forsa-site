## The Startup Phase
- Map and Meet Stakeholders
- Define and Refine Scope of Problem
- Narrow Parameters (time x cost x ...)
- Begin Solution Scaffolding


##### Notes:
- From 3 days to 2 weeks
- As many stakeholder groups represented as possible

<br>

## Build Phase

- Iterate solutions using early requirements with prototype-to-market quickly
- Analyze initial usage/user data
- Use observations from data to refine scope/requirements and build next iteration (along with other tools to increase uptake ie training, guides, ads)

<br>

## Handover Phase
- Assemble best practices for system management into training curriculae, tool admin documentation (guides, wikis, video tutorials, etc)
- Forsa-Embedded training
- Future Development Roadmap (docs+plan for how client can addon to the system/service/tools after our engagement ends)

<br>

### Example products/services using this model of engagement:
- Building public-facing technology tools (SMS, mobile and web apps, and others)
- Establishing data/analytics department or improving these practices within an organization
- Deploying a particular analytics tool (model, machine learning system, etc)
