<h2 id="strategy">STRATEGY</h2>

<p><em>We help NGOs, Businesses, and Governments understand how to engage with their constituents by designing and delivering better services and technologies.</em></p>

<p>We work with our clients to understand the community and constituents unique to each context. We leverage extensive experience designing services and cutting-edge technology tools to help our clients develop innovative strategies to address unique challenges. </p>

<h2 id="design">DESIGN</h2>

<p><em>We use community-centered design processes, a deep knowledge of cutting-edge technologies, and our experience with big data analytics to build bespoke solutions.</em></p>

<p>We combine community-centered design and agile management processes to develop services and technologies which are context responsive and user oriented. Our consultants work with you to understand your desired outcomes and constituents’ needs. We use rapid prototyping to assess different approaches, gather extensive feedback and user data, and refine the product to ensure that the final design is the best.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">IMPLEMENTATION</h2>

<p><em>We embed in organizations and communities to help implement solutions and technologies efficiently and effectively.</em></p>

<p>Our close involvement with organizations and communities ensures that implementation is responsive to our client’s needs, continuously incorporates feedback, and delivers on time and on budget. Our consultants operate in the most fragile and complex environments in the world and excel at delivering solutions in situations where others can’t. We’ll be on the ground working with partners and stakeholders, gathering inputs that require an in-person presence, and responding to needs as they arise.</p>

<h2 id="learning">LEARNING</h2>

<p><em>We use quantitative research and qualitative analysis methods to understand experiences, evaluating what works, what doesn’t, and why. We design and deliver experiential training programs for our clients, building communities of capable practitioners with each engagement.</em></p>

<p>We’re committed to ensuring that every engagement is an opportunity for growth and improvement.  Forsa consultants are experienced teachers, and we incorporate knowledge transfer into all of our projects. We work with our clients to help them use data and interdisciplinary methods to evaluate the efficacy of their work long after our engagement has finished. When appropriate, Forsa will also design and lead trainings for our clients and their partners. Our trainings are centered around experiential learning, and Forsa will make sure that everyone being trained has mastered the use of a product before we leave. </p>
